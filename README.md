# 🚦 Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Analysis – India 2020

## 📍 Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze road accident data from India for the year 2020. We aim to:
- Identify accident trends across states and time periods.
- Understand which types of accidents and vehicles are most dangerous.
- Provide insights that can help shape better road safety policies.

## 📊 Data Source

- **Source:** Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), Government of India
- **Format:** CSV
- **Key Columns:**
  - `Million Plus Cities`
  - `Cause category`
  - `Cause Subcategory`
  - `Outcome of Incident`
  - `Count`

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data wrangling
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
  - `plotly` – Interactive Choropleth map
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Top accident-prone cities** identified through aggregation of incident counts.
- **Human error, overspeeding**, and **traffic rule violations** are dominant causes.
- Fatal outcomes are significantly higher in certain subcategories.
- State-wise accident distributions were visualized using an interactive **choropleth map**.

---

## 📍 Visualization Examples

- 📊 **Bar Charts** for cause categories and fatal outcomes.
- 🗺️ **Interactive Choropleth Map**: Visualizes accident counts across Indian states using Plotly and GeoJSON.
- 🔥 **Heatmaps**: Visual representation of category correlations.
